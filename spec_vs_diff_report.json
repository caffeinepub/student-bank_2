  "summary": "The diff addresses both REQ-14 (admin bank details authorization fix) and REQ-15 (footer text update). The footer text is updated in DashboardLayout.tsx to '2026 Student Bank · vaibhavgavali'. The backend main.mo shows authorization logic using AccessControl.isAdmin. The frontend hooks (useQueries.ts) and BankDetailsPage/BankFormModal show bank detail mutations using the actor. The file-summaries confirm the intent of both fixes. Overall both requirements appear implemented.",
